# What
Just a journal for aquiring a skill

# Why
I'll try the meathod of documenting steps, challanges, threasholds, and frustraitions of the process of learning a skill (personal). GH wiki is really friendly to keep a gournal ,in. Plus there is nothing gloruise here having my notes public Just because GH does not allow me to have a wiki in a private repo 

More mumbling will be in the wiki


And sorry for my future self for stranding this at any point. Nothing needs to be completed the joy is in the journy not the destination :)
